A technical video for advanced users of Emacs

* Settings

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
; (setq isearch-lazy-highlight nil) ; remove lazy-highlight from incremental search
  (setq isearch-repeat-on-direction-change t) ; Remove "pause" when changing directions
  (setq isearch-wrap-pause nil) ; Never wrap isearch, either go up or down
  (setq search-ring-max 4) ; max length of search ring; default is 16; cycle using M-p and M-n
  (setq isearch-forward-thing-at-point '(region url email symbol sexp))
  (setq isearch-allow-prefix t) ; do not allow scrolling commands to exit search, does not work in org-mode
#+end_src

* Cancel search

=ESC ESC ESC=

or,

=C-g C-g=

* Reuse earlier searches (see =search-ring-max= above)

=M-p= or =M-n=

* Editing current search

=C-g= removes characters from search string not found in buffer. (Note: A second =C-g= at that point cancels the search entirely.)

=C-M-d= removes once character at a time from the search string (NEW)

=DEL= (=Backspace=) deletes the last typed character from the search string

=M-e= allows edits in minibuffer (more wide scale editing)

* Search at point (all commands presuppose you are in isearch)

=C-s C-w= search word *or* sometimes character at point (Note: Emacs decides for you if it will search a word or character (heuristic search))

One can also use numeric arguments or re-invoke =C-w= to add more words/characters

=C-s C-M-y= search one character at time =C-M-d= removes one character at time

*The heavy stuff*

=C-s C-M-w= as above but searches for a symbol instead of word

=C-s M-s C-e= appends line

=C-s C-M-z= search from point to character x

=C-s C-y= search current copy/killed item

*Some relief: New in Emacs 28: Search for "things"*

=M-s M-. (isearch-forward-thing-at-point)=

Searches for things at point include the following: symbol, list, sexp, defun, number, filename, url, email, uuid, word, sentence, whitespace, line, and page.

Also useful for searching a region

An example config:

=(setq isearch-forward-thing-at-point '(region url email symbol sexp))=

* Special Input for Incremental Search

=M-s SPC= toggle lax space searching

hello world
hello    world

=M-s c= or =M-c= toggle case searching

=M-s r= or =M-r= toggle regexp and non-regexp search

=M-s _= toggle symbol mode

=C-j= searches for a newline character; a nice way to see new lines quickly

=M-s h r= highlight search

=M-s h l= unhighlight search

=C-h C-h= help (works only if isearch is active)

=M-s M->= goes to last occurrence

=M-s M-<= goes to first occurrence
