# Notepad++: Interesting Features: At Points Compared With Emacs

## This is the first time I have seriously explored Notepad++

## Features work out the box with little configuration

## Truly Lovely integration in Windows

## Spell Check is easy to set up (plugin install)

## Documents are arranged by tabs

Better than Emacs at tabs.

## Scroll up/down by default

## Line operations

Edit/Line Operations

Move lines up/down
Delete duplicate lines
Sort lines

I especially liked `Remove Empty Lines (containing blank characters)`

## Increase zoom easily

Ctrl + middle mouse button

## Select and delete lines with a certain string

Find, Mark, Bookmark Line
Bookmark: Remove Bookmarked lines

Emacs `flush-lines` is easier and superior.

## Easily assign shortcuts to commands

Easier than Emacs in this regard. It tells you if you want to use a shortcut already in use.

## Plugins

Plugins install quickly. 
None of those I tried were buggy.  
They work without too much configuration.
Plugins Admin  

## Run Python Scripts

NppExec

```
python "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)"
```

## Export Markdown to HTML and PDF

MarkdownViewer++

## Show all characters

## Find in files

Easily find *content* in any folder (no need to install grep)

## Easily mark open files as "read only"

## Easily change case

Letter "u" in combination with Shift, Ctrl, Alt

Upper
Lower
Proper (Each word capitalized)
Sentence (First word capitalized)

## Integration with Windows

System Variables
Path

`C:\Program Files\Notepad++`

Use in Terminal

Type `notepad++` (plus optionally name of file)

Create an alias in PowerShell to make it even easier:

```
Set-Alias -Name np -Value "C:\Program Files\Notepad++\notepad++.exe"
```

## Create a macro to *add double asterisks* around markdown

## Begin/End select

Useful for selecting large blocks of text, where it might be cumbersome to scroll while keeping the mouse button or shift key pressed.

## Easily select columns with alt + drag

Column 1                      | Column 2

Text for the first column     | Text for the second column,
which may include various     | which might be about a
points or subjects
continues down the column.    | or continue the same topic.

## Things I don't like

### Smart highlighting (purely a visual aid)

Turn off by going to Preferences/Highlighting

### Multiple cursors don't work out the box

Install BetterMultiSelection, and then Ctrl click

### The auto-complete feature is Word centric, it does not work with lines

Install Auto-complete feature is word centric

### No abbrev-mode

One can create "snippets" using the Snippets Plugin
