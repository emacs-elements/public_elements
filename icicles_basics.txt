ICICLES AND THE MINIBUFFER

- Bolsters and supplements default Emacs Menu
- Basic concept: use tab completion
- M-x
- Type some text: org-, emacs
- Press tab
- Continue to type some text
- Press tab
- To select a candidate press tab tab
- <RET> to select candidate
- Then we have shift-tab which gives us regexp completion.

emacs ^emacs emacs$ -emacs- ^pack.+nts Shift-alt-* orderless

init emacs

- We follow the same process but get different suggestions

- icicles is based on vanilla Emacs. It tries to leave defaults as much as possible in tact. You will not for instance see completion candidates displayed until you hit `TAB' (or `S-TAB') as with some other completion frameworks which begin to show them as you type.
  This default behaviour can be changed. I suggest you start with defaults before changing anything to get a sense of how the program works by default.

HELP

type M-? in the minibuffer
M-S-TAB or ESC S-TAB provides help with keys (similar to which-key)
e.g. type C-h and then shift-tab
e.g. type f1 and then shift-tab

- Even if you use no other features of icicles than these, it will be a 100% booster for your work.
- You can turn off icy-mode any time to get back to vanilla Emacs.
- Its effects:
- org-roam completion
- buffer (C-x b)
- opening files
- M-x
- C-h v
